# International Mun Humbling Organization 

> Ancient Kerbals believed that the Mun was a big, spooky ghost which, no matter how
> many times they offered and no matter how graciously, would not come to brunch.
>
> Modern Kerbals think this too! So rude!

> But! We Kerbals now have rockets and electricty and computers that let us do more than spell out funny words in math class. I believe that we should commit ourselves to achieving the goal, before we get bored and do something else, of landing some Kerbals on the Mun and make friends up close. No single space will be more likely to impress on the Mun how rude it's been or how, really, there's no hard feelings and we just want to drink some coffee and talk about space stuff.

> My fellow Kerbals, has anyone heard the Mun actually decline an invitation? No? Perhaps it's just been really busy?

-- President John F. Kerbin
