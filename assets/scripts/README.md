# International Mun Humbling Organization

## Motivation

Ancient Kerbals believed that the Mun was a big, spooky ghost which, no matter how
many times they offered and no matter how graciously, would not come to brunch.

Modern Kerbals think this too.

But! Now we have rockets and electricity so we're gonna fly right up there to
the Mun, land on it and try and make friends up close. We've never _actually_
heard the Mun decline an invitation so perhaps it's just been really busy?

## Methods

Rockets!

Kinda!

There was a previous society dedicated to the same purpose: the National
Association for Acceptable Politesse (NAAP). It's methods were somewhat at odds
with IMHO's in that they stressed absolute automation of their spacecraft where
we prefer to keep pilots "in-the-loop". Automation is great up until it's not
and while they _did_ manage to achieve a landing for poor Bill Kerman the return
vessel was destroyed in the process and, moreover, all of their computer
automation was lost with it.

"We don't need version control!" said the NAAP's software engineers. Apparently
they also didn't believe in backups.

IMHO design assumes that the Kerbal pilot is the ultimate authority in-flight.
Computer systems are subordinate to and must aid the pilot, relieve tedium where
possible and give information for informed decision making. What can be
automated should but not to the extent that a Kerbal is left helpless in an
emergency.
