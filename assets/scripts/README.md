# Mission Profile

Suggested current mission profile involves the use of the following programs:

  * launch -- enter kerbin orbit
  * brake  -- roughly circularize kerbin orbit
  * transfer -- find Hohmann transfer maneuver for Kerbin -> Mun
  * [MANUAL] extraction -- remove lander from stage, coast to Mun
  * brake -- circularize spacecraft around Mun
  * [MANUAL] separation -- separate lander from command module
  * [MANUAL] de-orbit lander -- cause lander descent to Munar surface
  * land -- execute land, trim as appropriate
  * [MANUAL] celebrate -- plant flags, wave to the camera
  * [MANUAL] re-orbit lander -- execute orbiting for rendezvous with CM
  * [MANUAL] rendezvous -- rendezvous and dock with CM
  * [MANUAL] dump LM -- drop lander module in Munar orbit
  * transfer -- calculate and execute CM transfer to Kerbin
  * [MANUAL] re-entry -- re-enter Kerbin atmosphere, splash-down and enjoy parades

The careful reader will note that this is more manual than not. While maneuver
nodes are created there is not automatic execution of such. Rendezvous, a
complicated, error prone and time consuming maneuver, is entirely manual.
